# About:
The CRM Job Editor has been made available to help you reschedule jobs that have caused performance issues when executing during the day, it will allow you to edit the scheduling recurrence pattern as well as the next runtime of the jobs without having to make any SQL updates.

For other reading about the platform please refer to the blog the team and I post to: https://aka.ms/crminthefield

#### Note
See the releases page for other CRM editions. 

# Project Description
This utility is to be used for editing the CRM maintenance jobs automatically scheduled by the installation of CRM (ie: reindexing job, workflow cleanup, etc). 

# Applies to:
CRM 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016, D365 V9 OnPremise - this does *not* apply to CRM Online or dynamics.com. To edit your OrgDBOrgSettings (which apply to OnPrem and Online) visit my other project: https://github.com/seanmcne/orgdborgsettings.  Note: V9 will very likely be the last version with a build of this editor.
